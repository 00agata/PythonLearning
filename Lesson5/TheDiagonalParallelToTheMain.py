'''
Given an integer n, produce a two-dimensional
array of size (n√ón) and complete it according
to the following rules, and print with a single
space between characters:

    On the main diagonal write 0 .
    On the diagonals adjacent to the main, write 1 .
    On the next adjacent diagonals write 2 and so forth.

Print the elements of the resulting array.
